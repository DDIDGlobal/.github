## Mission

DDID Global Foundation is a nonprofit certification authority establishing blockchain-anchored verification of businesses, individuals, applications, and smart contracts. Built on BSV blockchain using vendor-neutral digital identity standards, we're building the trust layer the internet never had.

> *The internet developed protocols for communication but never developed a native protocol for trust.*

---

## The Problem

**$685 billion lost annually** to digital commerce trust failures—$485B in fraud, $200B in verification costs.

Centralized identity creates single points of failure. Legacy verification takes weeks at $100+ per check. Platform-based reputation locks users into proprietary ecosystems with 18-33% fees. Cross-border verification remains fragmented and manual.

---

## The Solution

DDID Global verifies **WHO**, **WHAT**, and **HOW**—enabling peer-to-peer commerce without intermediaries.

| Layer | Function |
|:------|:---------|
| **Entity & Individual Identity** | Legal, operational, and compliance verification |
| **Application Certification** | Security audits, privacy compliance, continuous monitoring |
| **Smart Contract Verification** | Formal audits, zero-knowledge proofs, vulnerability checks |

Certified entities transact through secure applications executing audited smart contracts—reducing costs 99% and compressing settlement from days to minutes.

## Key Benefits

- **Instant verification** — Seconds, not weeks
- **70% KYC cost reduction** for institutions
- **Sub-0.1% transaction costs** vs. 3-10% traditional fees
- **Portable reputation** — Build once, verify everywhere
- **Privacy-preserving** — Zero-knowledge proofs enable verification without exposing data

---

## The Model

Businesses donate annually ($2.5K–$100K based on size). Individuals certify free. This cross-subsidy creates network effects where ecosystem value compounds with each participant—no extractive rent-seeking.

All certificates deliver as blockchain-anchored credentials with instant global verification, cryptographic signing capability, and evolving on-chain reputation.

---

## Why Nonprofit

- Decisions serve the ecosystem, not shareholders
- All protocols are open-source and community-governed
- No competitive conflicts with certified entities
- 100% of revenue funds infrastructure and accessibility
